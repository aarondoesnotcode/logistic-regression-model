# logistic-regression-model
This is a machine learning model, trained and tested on data to predict whether a user has heart disease or not.
Disease = 1, no disease = 0

## brief summary of logistic-regression model with context
Used commonly whenever it comes to binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict a label (in this case, whether a user has heart disease, or not).

### Personal Notes 
#### These are notes I took, when developing and researching into the model

### Comments
**I put alot of comments throughout the model, so users and I could understand briefly what the use of it is for, without putting too much unneccessary information.**
